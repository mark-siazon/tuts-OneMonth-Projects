# Project 3: Todo List
Simple todo list app, using local storage to persist data.

## Links
- jQuery: http://jquery.com/
- localStorage: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp

## Challenge
* Add an interesting animation to the item removal. You can use a `fadeOut()`  or `slideDown()` method like we did in Project 2. Or any other type of interactive you like. 
* Add an "easter egg" to the project. So for example, if the `listItem === "dance"`, append a dance GIF to the todo list. Have fun with it!
