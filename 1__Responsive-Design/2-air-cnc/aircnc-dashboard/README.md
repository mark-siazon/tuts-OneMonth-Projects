**Responsive Design Course - 2nd Website Challenge pt.2**

- This project is the result of completing the part 2 of second website challenge from the Onemonth.com responsive design course. 
- It demonstrates the application of responsive design principles, following a mobile-first approach, to create a visually appealing and mobile-friendly webpage.
- I also added extra challenge by using css preprocessor (SASS)

## Description

- The challenge involved creating a responsive webpage using HTML and CSS. 
- The webpage showcases a fictional event and provides event details and location information.

## Getting Started

To view the webpage locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- CSS Reset: [`reset.css`](css/reset.css)
- Custom CSS Styles: [`style.css`](css/style.css)
- SASS [`styles.scss`](css/style.scss)

## Usage

To use the webpage as a template or starting point for your own projects:

1. Modify the content in `index.html` to reflect your desired event or information.
2. Customize the SCSS styles in [`styles.scss`](css/style.scss) to match your desired visual theme.
